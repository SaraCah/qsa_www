Once a decision has been made about permission to access this restricted record, please complete the ‘Access to Restricted Records Authorisation Form’ available here https://www.forgov.qld.gov.au/file/21646/download?token=p_7tILfK. This form must be signed by an officer with the delegation to grant access to the records in accordance with section 18(2) of the Public Records Act 2002.

This ‘Access to Restricted Records Authorisation Form’ does not need to be completed and records can instead be requested via Archives Gateway if:
records are returned to your agency using the file issue service and requestors are accessing records at your agency
a staff member from your agency is requesting to view these restricted records in the QSA Reading Room in Runcorn [note, this staff member must have permission to access restricted records]

Please return the completed form by email in PDF format to QSA at info@archives.qld.gov.au.

You must also notify the customer directly of your decision to grant or deny access to these restricted records.

If you require assistance or further information about completing this ‘Access to Restricted Records Authorisation Form’ or would like to discuss reviewing the restricted access period on a record for which your agency is responsible, please feel free to contact the Access Services team at QSA on 07) 3037 6777 or by email at info@archives.qld.gov.au
